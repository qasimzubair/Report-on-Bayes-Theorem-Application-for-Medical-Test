# Report-on-Bayes-Theorem-Application-for-Medical-Test

## Project Overview
This project covers multiple applications of **Bayes' Theorem** and **Naive Bayes Classification**. It demonstrates the use of probability theory in real-world scenarios like medical testing, spam detection, car value prediction, and basic machine learning classification.

### 1. Bayes' Theorem Application for Medical Test
- **Purpose**: Evaluate the accuracy of a medical test for detecting a disease (DDD).
- **Key Points**:
  - Computes the probability of a positive test result.
  - Calculates the probability of actually having the disease given a positive result.
- **Conclusion**: Despite a positive test, the chance of actually having the disease is very low (~0.09%).

### 2. Email Classification Using Bayes' Theorem
- **Purpose**: Classify emails (spam, low priority, high priority) based on the presence of the word "free."
- **Key Points**:
  - Calculates the probability that an email containing "free" is spam.
- **Conclusion**: High chance (~92.28%) that an email with "free" is spam.

### 3. Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) for Car Value
- **Purpose**: Build CPTs based on car attributes like mileage, engine condition, and air conditioning status.
- **Key Points**:
  - Prior probabilities and conditional probabilities computed.
  - Car value estimated based on these CPTs.
- **Conclusion**: CPTs help predict car value based on features.

### 4. Naive Bayes Classification Report
- **Purpose**: Classify a new instance (1,1,0) using a Naive Bayes Classifier trained on a small dataset.
- **Key Points**:
  - Prior and likelihood probabilities calculated.
  - Posterior probabilities used for classification.
- **Result**: Instance classified as **positive (+)**.
